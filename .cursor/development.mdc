# Development & Testing Guidelines

## Testing Requirements

- Test extension in Chrome's developer mode
- Verify blocking works across different site types
- Test storage sync across multiple Chrome instances
- Ensure popup UI works correctly in both light and dark modes
- Validate domain parsing with various input formats

## Performance Considerations

- Use single declarativeNetRequest rule for all blocked domains
- Minimize DOM manipulations in popup rendering
- Cache frequently accessed storage data
- Use efficient event listeners with proper cleanup

## Security & Privacy

- Follow Chrome extension security best practices
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) as defined in manifest
- Never store sensitive user data
- Respect user privacy - only block sites they explicitly add

## Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive function names that explain intent
- Group related functionality together
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)

## Browser Compatibility

- Target Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 support)
- Use modern JavaScript features without polyfills
- Test on different screen sizes and resolutions
- Ensure extension works in incognito mode if needed
